## MapBox
This is an android application that lets user request and send their current location to their family and friends.

## Motivation
The project started because I wanted a convenient way to let my family and friends know where I was and vice versa. Instead of an application with location service bundled along such as Messenger, SnapChat, and Instagrams, I wanted to make an application dedicated to location sharing.
